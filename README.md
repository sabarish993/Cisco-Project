# Cisco-Project
 Enterprise-Network-Cisco-Packet-Tracer
## Project Overview
This project showcases a detailed networking design implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer, featuring dynamic routing protocols, network address translation (NAT), access control lists (ACLs), and DHCP configuration. The topology is segmented into distinct zones to emulate real-world enterprise networking environments, such as:

1. **Access Zone**
2. **Core Operations Zone**
3. **Distribution Zone**

The design integrates multiple routing protocols, ensuring efficient and robust communication across the zones.

## Key Features

### 1. **Routing Protocols**
   - **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First):** Implemented for routing in the Distribution Zone to optimize path selection and ensure scalability.
   - **EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol):** Used in the Core Operations Zone for its quick convergence and efficient resource utilization.
   - **RIP (Routing Information Protocol):** Used in the Distribution Zone for its quick convergence.

### 2. **Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)**
   - Centralized DHCP servers assign IP addresses dynamically to devices in each zone.
   - Configuration ensures optimal address allocation and efficient IP management.

### 3. **Network Address Translation (NAT)**
   - NAT enables internal devices to communicate externally while maintaining internal network security.
   - Properly configured to handle translation between public and private IP ranges.

### 4. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**
   - ACLs are applied to secure traffic and enforce policies.
   - Granular control over incoming and outgoing traffic based on IP, protocol, and port.

### 5. **Virtual Private Network (VPN)**
   - Emulated in the topology to simulate secure inter-zone communication.

## Network Topology Details

### 1. **Access Zone**
   - Includes devices such as PCs, laptops, and DHCP servers.
   - Devices receive IP configurations dynamically via the DHCP server.
   - Configurations ensure seamless access to shared resources.

### 2. **Core Operations Zone**
   - Acts as the backbone of the network, connecting the Access and Distribution Zones.
   - Utilizes EIGRP for dynamic routing.
   - Redundancy is built into the design to ensure high availability.

### 3. **Distribution Zone**
   - Hosts servers for enterprise applications and services.
   - OSPF routing enables scalability for large-scale network expansions.
   - NAT is implemented for external connectivity.

## Devices and Configurations

### Key Devices
- **Routers:** Handle inter-zone routing and protocol redistribution.
- **Switches:** Provide Layer 2 connectivity within each zone.
- **Servers:** Serve DHCP, NAT, and application functions.
- **End Devices:** PCs, laptops, and other client devices.

### Addressing Scheme
- The network uses private IP ranges for internal communication.
- Public IPs are allocated for NAT configurations to enable external connectivity.

### Routing Tables
- Preconfigured routing tables for EIGRP and OSPF ensure optimized routing.

---

## Implementation Highlights

### DHCP Configuration
- Centralized DHCP servers are configured with specific scopes for each subnet.
- Ensures IP address management is automated and conflict-free.

### NAT Setup
- Internal devices are translated to public IP addresses for external communication.
- Configured on edge routers with proper access rules.

### ACLs
- Secures traffic by permitting or denying specific traffic flows.
- Rules are designed to ensure minimal overhead and maximum security.

## Steps to Recreate

### Prerequisites
- Cisco Packet Tracer (version X.X or higher).
- Understanding of routing protocols, NAT, ACLs, and DHCP.

### Configuration Steps
1. **Setup the Topology:**
   - Arrange routers, switches, and end devices as per the provided topology.
   
2. **Configure Devices:**
   - Assign IP addresses to interfaces based on the IP addressing scheme.
   - Enable routing protocols (OSPF/EIGRP) on the respective routers.

3. **Configure DHCP Servers:**
   - Define DHCP pools and scopes for each subnet.
   - Bind interfaces to their respective pools.

4. **Implement NAT:**
   - Configure NAT on edge routers for IP translation.

5. **Apply ACLs:**
   - Define access rules to permit/deny traffic as required.
   - Apply rules to the appropriate interfaces.

6. **Test Connectivity:**
   - Use `ping` and `traceroute` to verify inter-device communication.
   - Ensure dynamic address assignment via DHCP.

## Results
- Successful communication between devices in all zones.
- Dynamic IP assignment through DHCP.
- External connectivity via NAT.
- Secure and optimized traffic routing using OSPF and EIGRP.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrate IPv6 for modern networking support.
- Extend the topology to include additional zones and devices.
- Implement advanced security features, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems.
